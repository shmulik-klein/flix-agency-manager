# Flix Agencies Manager

This repository holds the frontend (Angular) and the backend (Kotlin + Spring Boot) for Flix's home assignment for the agencies manager.
It includes two `Dockerfile` files - one for each component and a `docker-compose.yaml` to easily start up the application.

Run the following from root to start the application:
```
docker-compose up
```
